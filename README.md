### A bit more about me:
- 🎮 I used to play video games a lot! I don't anymore because I lost interest. Some of my favorite genres were:
  - **RPGs** (In the past also **MMORPGs** like Lineage 2)
  - **Puzzle**
  - **Adventure**
- ⚡ Nevertheless, I would still like to be involved in game development in some way.
- 🎧 I love **OST** from such games as:
  - **Machinarium**
  - **Sonic Adventure 1 & 2**
  - **Minecraft**
  - **Undertale**
  - ... and more!
- 🎵 But I also enjoy listening to **various music genres**, including different **flavors of rock** (christian, alternative, hard, rap), **electronic**, **trance** and others.
- 🛣️ Some other interests of mine include **reading books**, **exploring nature and technology**, **learning languages** and more.
